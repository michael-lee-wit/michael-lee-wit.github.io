							<h2>Westfield Terms and Conditions</h2>
							<div>
							   <p>These terms and conditions ("Terms and Conditions") govern your use and purchase of products or services &nbsp;from uk.westfield.com and our mobile app (the "Site") provided by Westfield Corporation, its subsidiaries, affiliates and related entities ("Westfield", "we", "us", and "our") and offered for Users in the United Kingdom. &nbsp;Additional or separate terms may apply to your use of other Westfield websites, services, or apps, or participation in any promotion. &nbsp;To the extent that the provisions of any additional terms conflict with these Terms and Conditions, the provisions of the additional terms will govern. By downloading, installing or using the Site, or accessing our website, you ("User", "you" or "your") agree to the Terms and Conditions below. &nbsp;</p>
							   <p>To go directly to specific sections, please see below:</p>
							   <p><a>I. GENERAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS AND RESTRICTIONS ON USE</a></p>
							   <p><a>II. PRIVACY</a></p>
							   <p><a>III. LINKS</a></p>
							   <p><a>IV. REVIEWS, COMMENTS AND OTHER SUBMISSIONS</a></p>

							   <p><b><a name="generalterms" id="generalterms"></a>I. GENERAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS AND RESTRICTIONS ON USE&nbsp;</b></p>

Those who access the Site from locations outside of the UK are responsible for compliance with local laws if and to the extent local laws are applicable.&nbsp;</p>
							   <p>Westfield reserves the right to remove any information or material on the Site without warning, and without prejudice to any other accrued rights, and/or make available such information or material when required to do so by law or when requested to do so by regulatory bodies or law enforcement organisations.</p>
							   <p><b>B. Children.</b> The Site and related services are not aimed at nor intended for children under the age of 16. You must be 16 years of age or over to use the Site. &nbsp;If you are under 18 years of age (but over 16), you must obtain the consent of a parent or guardian before accessing or using the Site or creating a Registered Account (as described below).&nbsp;</p>
							   <p><b>C. Copyrights and Trademarks.</b> All content and materials on the Site, such as text, graphics, logos, button icons, images, audio clips, digital downloads, data compilations and software is the property of Westfield and/or third party licensors and protected by English and international copyright laws. &nbsp;All trade marks, service marks, and trade names (including the look and feel of the Site) are owned by Westfield. The content and materials are intended for your personal, non-commercial use. &nbsp;You may make one copy of the materials displayed on the Site for your personal, non-commercial use only. &nbsp;No right, title or interest in any content or materials is transferred to you as a result of any such copying. &nbsp;You may not otherwise reproduce, republish, upload, post, transmit, modify, create derivative works from, sell or distribute in any way the content and materials on the Site.</p>
							   <p><b>D. Restrictions on Use.</b> You agree to use the Site and related services only for lawful purposes and to follow all applicable laws and regulations. While using the Services, you will not:&nbsp;</p>
							   <p>. Violate any laws, regulations, third party rights, including intellectual property rights, or Westfield's policies; publish, post, distribute, disseminate or otherwise transmit, defamatory offensive, infringing, obscene, indecent or other unlawful or objectionable material or information;</p>
							   <p>. Do anything to negatively affect Westfield's goodwill, name or reputation;</p>
							   <p>. Modify, disrupt, impair, alter or interfere with the use, features, functions, operation or maintenance of the Site or the rights or use and enjoyment of the Site by any other person, company or enterprise (collectively, "Person"); or&nbsp;</p>
							   <p>. Collect, obtain, compile, transmit, reproduce, delete, revise, display any material or information, whether personally identifiable or not, posted by or concerning any other Person in connection with use of the Site, unless you have obtained the express, prior permission of such other Person.</p>
							   <p><b>E. Registration and Account Information.</b> To use the services offered through the Site, a User must register and create an account. &nbsp;To register and create an account, you must create login details (a username and password) and provide personal information ("Registered Account"). You agree to provide true, accurate and current information. You are not obliged to provide Westfield with any optional information requested. As a registered User, you must maintain confidentiality of your login details and remain responsible for all activities that occur within your Registered Account. &nbsp;Should you become aware of or suspect any unauthorised use(s) of your Registered Account, you will immediately notify Westfield. &nbsp;You will ensure that you log out of your Registered Account at the end of each session when accessing the additional services.</p>
							   <p>You can use your Registered Account to access the additional services listed below. &nbsp;Please click on the links below to access the additional terms and conditions that apply specifically to each service.</p>
							   <p>. <a>Terms&nbsp;and Conditions</a>&nbsp;to Smart Parking Services - see section below.&nbsp;</p>
							   <p><b>F. Card Authorisation.</b>&nbsp;When you set up your Registered Account you may need to add a payment card in order to make the most of some of the features on the Site.</p>
							   <p>In order to verify your payment card when you add it to your Registered Account or when you update the payment card details, we may issue an 'authorisation hold' for a small amount to your card. This amount is never actually charged to your account, but you may see a "pending" charge for the authorised amount. For example you might see a temporary charge authorisation for GBP &#163;1 or less on your bank or card statement. It is independent of any payment transaction that you make using the Sites - i.e. it is not tied to a smart parking payment or another service. If your payment card issuing bank is in another country, you will see a pending charge for a similar amount in your regional currency.</p>
							   <p>Westfield immediately voids the authorisation hold, but it may take a few business days for your card issuing bank to release the hold on your account; actual timing depending on your bank's policy.</p>
							   <p>We issue authorisation holds as a way to protect against fraud that may result from unauthorised card usage and to ensure that your saved payment card can be used to pay for features requiring payment. If you would like to confirm a specific item on your statement, please contact your bank directly.</p>
							   <p><b>G. Mobile Services.</b> The Site includes certain services that are available via a mobile device, including (i) the ability to browse the Site from a mobile device and (ii) the ability to access certain features through an application downloaded and installed on a mobile device (collectively, the "Mobile Services"). To the extent you access the Site through a mobile device, your mobile operator's standard charges, data rates and other fees may apply. In addition, downloading, installing, or using certain Mobile Services may be prohibited or restricted by your operator, and not all Mobile Services may work with all operators or devices. In the event you change or deactivate your mobile telephone number, you agree to promptly update your Registered Account information to ensure that your messages are not sent to any other person. The Site, some of its features or functionalities, may not be available on all devices. We do not guarantee that all or any features or functionalities of the Site will work on any particular device.&nbsp;</p>
							   <p>If you use the Mobile Services you must also comply with the terms and conditions of the Apple App Store, Google Play or any other app store from which you download the Mobile Services. There may be updates to the Mobile Services and you are responsible for installing updates as prompted by your device or app store. You may not be able to access or use the Mobile Services unless you install updates.&nbsp;</p>

Unless specifically stated otherwise, Westfield is not responsible for the information on the Site and makes no warranty in respect of its timeliness, accuracy or availability. Westfield disclaims all liability arising from any reliance placed on such information to the fullest extent permissible by English law.</p>
							   <p>In addition, where the Site contains details provided by third parties like information about shops or restaurants (including opening hours, menus and availability of stock), Westfield makes no promise that those details are up-to date or accurate.</p>

										   <p>4. Members can earn points for Qualifying Purchases made at any Retailers, and on other purchases or offers that Westfield may notify you from time to time at the rate of 10 (ten) points for each Qualifying Purchase in excess of &#163;20 (Twenty Pounds). For the avoidance of doubt, Qualifying Points are only earned for each and every Qualifying Purchase and not earned based on the value of the Qualifying Purchase (see illustrations below). </p>
										   <p>Illustrations:</p>
										   <p>Example 1:</p>
										   <p>Spend at a retailer of &#163;20</p>
										   <p>Qualifying Points for the spend: 10 points</p>
										   <p>Example 2:</p>
										   <p>Spend at a retailer of &#163;400</p>
										   <p>Qualifying Points for the spend: 10 points</p>
										   <p>Example 3:</p>
										   <p>Spend at a retailer of &#163;10.00</p>
										   <p>Qualifying Points for the spend: 0 points</p>
										   <p>5. Members will earn Qualifying Points on each Qualifying Purchase from the date it is posted to the Member's Loyalty Account.&nbsp;The Qualifying Points a Member earns will be reduced by the amount of any Excluded Purchases that are refunded or returned by the Member to a Retailer. Qualifying Points have no expiry date provided the Member makes a Qualifying Purchase at the Centre once in each Membership Year.</p>
										   <p>6. The minimum number of Qualifying Points to entitle a Member for a Cashback is 200 (Two Hundred) Qualifying Points.&nbsp;A Cashback will only be credited to and made available on the card that is linked to your account when a minimum amount of &#163;10.00 (Ten Pounds) is met from any of the Qualifying Financial Institutions. Any Cashbacks issued will be valid for a period of two (2) months and will be credited against purchases made in person at retailers in the Centre. Cashbacks that are presented after the expiry date stated will not be valid. </p>
										   <p>7. The maximum number of Cashbacks that a Member can earn in any Westfield Club Year is 4 (four). For the avoidance of doubt, whilst you can continue to collect Qualifying Points until you reach the 200 point threshold, no further cashbacks will be issued until the new membership year.</p>
										   <p>8. The Retailers, Excluded Purchases and the Cashback rewards (including, rates, earn, collection and capping) are subject to periodic review and change by Westfield. All decisions regarding the foregoing will be final and binding. For the avoidance of any doubt, Qualifying Purchases cannot be accumulated to gross-up the retail spend for another loyalty programme that is managed or operated by any Retailer or any third party provider other than Westfield. </p>
										   <p>9. Westfield may notify Members from time to time of any special promotions where Members can earn extra Points. We may from time to time offer you Loyalty Account bonus points for specific promotions, subject to availability, but you will always be advised of the bonus points when the offer is made.</p>
										   <p>10. We reserve the right to vary the Qualifying Points available, and the rate at which points will be allocated, from time to time or to cease to offer Qualifying Points. Any change will be notified by the display of notices in our Centre, advised to you in loyalty emails, or by advertising on our website.</p>
										   <p>11. Qualifying Points, bonus points or Cashbacks cannot be transferred from one person or Loyalty Account to another unless specifically notified and agreed by us.</p>
										   <p>12. We reserve the right not to send Members an email in the event that the Qualifying Points balance has not changed from the previous statement, or insufficient points have been earned to generate Cashback.</p>
										   <p>13. The Member acknowledges that there may be a lapse of time between a Qualifying Purchases being made and the crediting of the Qualifying Points and/or Cashbacks. Westfield does not represent or warrant that the Cashback will be immediately reflected in the Member's statement. </p>
										   <p>14. Any Cashback, including cashback which is pending credit into the Member's Loyalty Account, will become invalid upon the occurrence of any one of the following:</p>
										   <p style="margin-left: 40px;">(i) any cancellation, termination or suspension of the Cashback rights, whether voluntary or involuntary; and/or<br> (ii) if the Member has committed or suspected to have committed any fraudulent, wrongful or unlawful acts or have not fulfilled or breached his/her obligations, in relation to the Member's Westfield Loyalty Club Account or these terms and conditions.</p>
										   <p>For the avoidance of doubt, if any of the above occurs, no refund, extension or compensation will be given by Westfield.</p>
										   <p>15. Westfield has the right to cancel, terminate or suspend the Cashback by giving prior adequate notice to Members. For the avoidance of doubt, any such cancellation, termination or suspension by Westfield of the Cashback will not entitle the Cardmember to any compensation from Westfield for any loss or damage suffered by the Cardmember, whether directly or indirectly, as a result of such cancellation, termination or suspension. </p>
										   <p>16. If Cashback is awarded to Members or persons who have committed or suspected of committing any fraudulent, wrongful or unlawful acts in relation to the Westfield Club or any facility, service and/or accommodation provided by Westfield, Westfield reserves the right to disqualify such Members or persons from earning or using the Cashback. Such acts may result in forfeiture of any Cashback earned as well as cancellation or termination (whether voluntary or involuntary) of the Member's right to be party to the Westfield Club. </p>
										   <p>17. Westfield will not be liable for any default due to any act of God, war, riot, strike, lockout, industrial action, fire, flood, drought, storm, epidemic, pandemic, technical or system failure or any event beyond the reasonable control of Westfield. </p>
										   <p>18. Your membership of the Westfield Club starts when your Account is opened, or when we determine the Westfield Club is available to you and ends when your Account is closed or when we determine that the Westfield Club is no longer in operation. </p>
										   <p>19. We reserve the right to withdraw or cancel the Westfield Club at any time giving Members seven days' notice in writing.</p>
										   <p>20. We reserve the right to change or amend the terms and conditions of the Westfield Club. Any changes will be notified by the display of notices in our Centre, advised in writing or advertised on our website.</p>
										   <p>21. We reserve the right to take any appropriate action where the Member has breached the terms and conditions of the Westfield Club. </p>
										   <p>22. In the case of dispute, the decision of Westfield shall be final. Please make sure your Loyalty Account details are kept up-to-date and accurate to minimise security risks. We cannot be responsible for non-receipt of Cashback.</p>
										   <p>23. These terms and conditions do not affect your legal rights.</p>
										   <p>24. You understand that membership of the Westfield Club will mean that our affiliates, subsidiaries, parent holding companies and other approved organisations may aggregate or use transactional data only for the purposes of analysis and so that specific Westfield Club offers may be made to you in accordance with <a>our privacy policy</a>. You may unsubscribe from receiving Westfield Club marketing communications at any time.</p>
										   <p>25. The Members agree that their continued usage of the Westfield Club constitutes their acceptance of these Westfield Club terms and conditions as changed or varied from time to time).</p>
										   <p>26. Westfield manages and operates the Westfield Club and is neither a partner nor joint venture partner, affiliated entity or subsidiary of any participating merchants, suppliers or Retailers. Westfield shall not be responsible for any defect or any other loss or damage that may be suffered in connection with any goods or services purchased by Members. Westfield expressly excludes and disclaims any, representations, warranties, or endorsements, expressed or implied, written or oral, including but not limited to, any warranty of quality, merchantability or suitability or fitness for a particular purpose in respect of any goods or services. Any dispute in relation to the warranty or quality of any goods or services or any terms and conditions in respect thereof shall be settled directly between the Member and the relevant merchant, supplier or Retailer. Westfield will bear no responsibility for resolving any dispute. </p>
										   <p>27. To the fullest extent permitted by law, Westfield (including its officers, servants, employees, representatives and/or agents, including any third parties) is not liable for any loss or damages which may arise in connection with the Cashback. </p>
										   <p>28. Any terms and conditions applicable to these terms and conditions which are illegal, prohibited or unenforceable under any law or regulation shall be ineffective to the extent of such illegality, voidness, prohibition or unenforceability without invalidating the remaining provisions.</p>
										   <p>31. These terms and conditions are governed by and construed under the laws of England.&nbsp;</p>
